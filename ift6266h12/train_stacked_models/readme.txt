I have spent some time developing this framework to stack different models together while 
taking into account the best pylearn2 features currently available to us. 

For the purpose of this small demo, I just simply stacked 3 autoencoders together. The dataset
I used is a randomly generated toy set.

To see the training procedure:

python test.py

You could easily modify the scripts to stack more complicated models together.

I hope this helps people who have trouble to follow the over-outdated pylearn2 examples. (Nearly all
of them are broken for now) 

You are very welcome to talk to me about any ideas to make this framework better.
